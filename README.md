## SSD: Self-supervised Distillation for Heterophilic Graph Representation Learning

## Framework

![Framework](Framework.png)



## Environment Settings
This implementation is based on Python3. To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

* python 3.8
* torch 1.13.0
* numpy 1.24.3
* dgl 1.12


## SSD
The data folder contains five heterophilic  benchmark datasets (Chameleon, Squirrel, Cornell, Texas, Wisconsin), and five homophilic datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Photo, Physics).

## Acknowledge 

The code is implemented based on  Contrastive Multi-View Representation Learning on Graphs. [\[code\]](https://github.com/kavehhassani/mvgrl)
